    <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
    <h4>To prepare a dough:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ingridients. Flour better to sift twice to make a cake fluffy.</li>
        <li>Backing powder is needed only if you're unsure that you'll manage to shake up eggs properly. Amount of ingridients is calculated for a backing mold 18-20 cm in diameter. During backing you may also need backing paper. </li>
        <li>Turn on the oven to preheat it to 170°.</li>
        <li>Divide eggs to whites and yolk parts. To whites add salt, vanilin and half of sugar.</li>
        <li>Shake up until the foam will be thick and stable. If to turn over the bowl the mass will not move.</li>
        <li>Yolks shake up with second part of sugar until slightly whitening. They are suposed to get a bit bigger.</li>
        <li>Carefuly merge and mix whites with yolks until smooth. If the consistency is correct, <b>don't</b> add backing powder.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, vanilin and backing powder (if needed) into a bowl with eggs. Mix carefuly but not long all together. You shouldn't have any unkneaded lumps of flour.</li>
        <li>Bake in a split ring 18 cm in diameter, 9 cm high. The bottom needs to be covered with backing paper. <b>Do not lubricate the walls of the mold with anything!</b></li>
        <li>Pour out the dough and level it out. You can knock on the table a couple of times so that there are no voids. Put it in an oven preheated to 170 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Check the readiness with a wooden stick - it should come out dry and clean. Do not open the oven for the first 20-25 minutes, otherwise the biscuit will fall off.</li>
        <li>Leave the ready biscuit to cool down for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the cake out of the ring using a knife and let it cool completely.</li>
        <li>Better to wrap the cooled cake in a bag and put it in the refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours. During this time, the moisture in the biscuit will be evenly distributed, and the cake will not crumble when cutting. This step is <b>NOT NECESSARY</b>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To prepare a cream:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the cheese and cream during 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sugar powder and mix.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry strawberries, slice thin.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Decoration:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the cake carefuly to 2-3 layers.</li>
        <li>According to amount of cake slices, pay attention to amount of cream you have. You should spread it evenly and enouth for top too.</li>
        <li>Between layers of cake, place strawberry slices on top of the cream.</li>
        <li>Decorate cake due to your taske with cream, grated chocholate, sugar powder and strawberries.</li>
    </ol>
